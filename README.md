**Muted Role Ban Bot**

This is a Discord bot written in Python using the Discord.py library. The bot is designed to ban all users with the "muted" role when it starts and connects to Discord.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed
    Discord.py library installed. Install it using pip:

    pip install discord.py

Setup

    Clone this repository to your local machine.

    Obtain your Discord bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.

    Replace YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN in bot.py with your actual Discord bot token.

    Set your server's ID by replacing YOUR_GUILD_ID in bot.py with your Discord server's ID.

How to Run

    Open a terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where bot.py is located.

    Run the bot using the following command:

    python bot.py

Behavior

When the bot is started, it will log in as the specified bot user. It will then attempt to find the role named "muted" in the Discord server with the provided GUILD_ID. If the role is found, the bot will proceed to ban all users who have the "muted" role. Any users who cannot be banned (e.g., due to lacking permissions) will be skipped.

The bot will print the message "Bot is logged in as <BotUsername>" when it successfully logs in to Discord. After banning all the users with the "muted" role, it will print a message listing the banned users' display names.

Note: Ensure that your bot has the necessary permissions to ban users on the server. Be cautious when running the bot, as banning users is a permanent action.
